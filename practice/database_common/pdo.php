In PHP, PDO stands for "PHP Data Objects." It is a database abstraction layer that provides a consistent interface for interacting with databases. PDO allows developers to work with various database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) using the same set of functions and methods, making it easier to switch between different database backends without modifying much of the code.

PDO provides three main components:

PDO Class: It represents a connection between PHP and the database server. It is used to establish a connection and perform operations such as querying the database.

PDOStatement Class: It represents a prepared statement, which allows you to execute SQL queries with parameters. Prepared statements are important for preventing SQL injection attacks and increasing query performance.

PDOException Class: It represents errors and exceptions that occur during database operations. When using PDO, you can catch PDOExceptions to handle errors gracefully.

Here's a simple example of using PDO to connect to a MySQL database and fetch some data:


// Database connection settings
$dsn = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase';
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';

try {
    // Create a PDO instance
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);

    // Set PDO attributes (optional)
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

    // Prepare and execute a query
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > :age');
    $stmt->execute(['age' => 25]);

    // Fetch data
    $users = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    // Do something with the data
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user['name'] . ', Age: ' . $user['age'] . '<br>';
    }
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
